# Core Â· AI-First Governance Repository

This repository now hosts the lightweight scaffolding for the AI-First v2.0 planning cycle.
The operational history of v1.9 has been preserved intact inside [`archive/v1.9`](archive/v1.9/README.md).

---

## v2.0 (Current)
- **Purpose:** Provide a clean surface for clarity-first planning and documentation updates.
- **Core docs:**
  - `meta/AI_First_System_Architecture_v2.0.md`
  - `meta/AI_First_Roadmap_v2.0.md`
  - `meta/AI_First_Handbook_v2.0.md`
  - `meta/Human_in_the_Loop_Playbook_v2.0.md`
  - `docs/AI_First_Business_Case_v2.0.md`
- **Status:** Draft scaffolds awaiting refreshed content.
- **Working agreement:** Keep changes focused on v2.0 initiatives; reference v1.9 materials from the archive when needed.

## v1.9 Archive
- The full freeze snapshot, including artefacts, diagnostics, and tickets, lives under [`archive/v1.9`](archive/v1.9/README.md).
- Changes in this branch do not modify the archive; refer to the manifest for provenance and integrity guarantees.

---

## Contribution Notes
- Maintainers can evolve the v2.0 core docs directly in this repo.
- Historical context should be sourced from the archive to avoid regressions.
- Automation and scripts will be reintroduced as the v2.0 roadmap solidifies.
