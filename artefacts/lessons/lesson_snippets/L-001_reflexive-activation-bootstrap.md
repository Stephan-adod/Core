# Reflexive Activation Bootstrap

## Insight
- Reflexive activation requires a lightweight loop that keeps lessons close to the operator workflow.

## Impact
- Aligns the roadmap and system architecture around stable v2.1 docs and removes churn from versioned filenames.

## Next Steps
- Add the lesson collector prompt to the weekly reflection loop and keep the lesson log current.
