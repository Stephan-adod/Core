# Meta Inventory Screening Â· v2.4

## Scope
- Directories scanned: `meta/`, `docs/`
- Focus artefacts: `meta/CORE_INDEX.md`, `meta/AI_First_Roadmap.md`, `meta/AI_First_System_Architecture.md`, `meta/Human_in_the_Loop_Playbook.md`
- Validation targets: front matter completeness (title, version, status, updated, layer, owner) & canonical link stability (no `v2.3` references)

## Inventory Summary

| path | version | status | updated | health |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `meta/CORE_INDEX.md` | v2.4.6 | active | 2025-10-21 | ðŸŸ¡ paused (drift waiver references v2.3 archive) |
| `meta/AI_First_Roadmap.md` | v2.4.6 | active | 2025-10-21 | ðŸŸ¡ paused (drift waiver references v2.3 archive) |
| `meta/AI_First_System_Architecture.md` | v2.4.6 | active | 2025-10-24 | ðŸŸ¡ paused (drift waiver notes diagram still at v2.3) |
| `meta/Human_in_the_Loop_Playbook.md` | v2.4.6 | active | 2025-10-21 | ðŸ”´ mismatch (owner placeholder `(assign)`) |

## Findings

### `meta/CORE_INDEX.md`
- Front matter complete (title/version/status/updated/layer/owner).
- Drift waiver still references the legacy v2.3 archive while migration to the v2.4 archive is pending.

### `meta/AI_First_Roadmap.md`
- Front matter complete.
- Drift waiver still references the legacy v2.3 archive text; replace once the v2.4 archive goes live.

### `meta/AI_First_System_Architecture.md`
- Front matter complete with owner `stephan-adod`.
- Drift waiver documents that the L3 diagram remains on the v2.3 asset until migration wraps; upgrade to v2.4 to close the waiver.

### `meta/Human_in_the_Loop_Playbook.md`
- Owner field is a placeholder (`(assign)`), so accountability is not yet recorded.
- Drift waiver still references the legacy v2.3 archive text; remove after the archive migration.
